# RAG Systems with LLMs
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks related to the use and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. These notebooks are designed to provide practical examples and insights into how LLMs can be leveraged to enhance information retrieval and generation tasks.

Special thanks to the amazing work of LLM ZoomCamp for their invaluable resources and guidance.
