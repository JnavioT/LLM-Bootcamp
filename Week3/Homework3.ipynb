In this case, it seems like the model is trying to convert the car brand ‘Nissan’ into a numerical value, which isn’t possible.\\nTo resolve this issue, you can encode categorical variables like car brands into numerical values. One common method is one-hot encoding, which creates new binary columns for each category/label present in the original column.\\nHere’s an example of how you can perform one-hot encoding using pandas:\\nimport pandas as pd\\n# Assuming 'data' is your DataFrame and 'brand' is the column with car brands\\ndata_encoded = pd.get_dummies(data, columns=['brand'])\\nIn this code, pd.get_dummies() creates a new DataFrame where the ‘brand’ column is replaced with binary columns for each brand (e.g., ‘brand_Nissan’, ‘brand_Toyota’, etc.).

You just update it in your folder and trigger the build one more time.\\nThey consume extra space on your disk. Unless you don’t want to re-run the previously existing containers, it is better to use the `--rm` option.\\nThe right way to say: “Why do we remove the docker container in our system?”. Well the docker image is still kept; it is the container that is not kept. Upon execution, images are not modified; only containers are.\\nThe option `--rm` is for removing containers. The images remain until you remove them manually. If you don’t specify a version when building an image, it will always rebuild and replace the latest tag. `docker images` shows you all the image you have pulled or build so far.\\nDuring development and testing you usually specify `--rm` to get the containers auto removed upon exit. Otherwise they get accumulated in a stopped state, taking up space. `docker ps -a` shows you all the containers you have in your host. Each time you change Pipfile (or any file you baked into the container), you rebuild the image under the same tag or a new tag. It’s important to understand the difference between the term “docker image” and “docker container”. Image is what we build with all the resources baked in. You can move it around, maintain it in a repository, share it. Then we use the image to spin up instances of it and they are called containers.\\nAdded by Muhammad Awon',\n",

The output can be, for example, the average value of all the outputs of each model. This is called bagging.\\nXGBoost trains several models sequentially: the previous model error is used to train the following model. Weights are used to ponderate the models such as the best models have higher weights and are therefore favored for the final output. This method is called boosting.\\nNote that boosting is not necessarily better than bagging.\\nMélanie Fouesnard\\nBagging stands for “Bootstrap Aggregation” - it involves taking multiple samples with replacement to derive multiple training datasets from the original training dataset (bootstrapping), training a classifier (e.g. decision trees or stumps for Random Forests) on each such training dataset, and then combining the the predictions (aggregation) to obtain the final prediction. For classification, predictions are combined via voting; for regression, via averaging. Bagging can be done in parallel, since the various classifiers are independent. Bagging decreases variance (but not bias) and is robust against overfitting.\\nBoosting, on the other hand, is sequential - each model learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. Observations are given different weights - observations/samples misclassified by the previous classifier are given a higher weight, and this process is continued until a stopping condition is reached (e.g. max. No. of models is reached, or error is acceptably small, etc.). Boosting reduces bias & is generally more accurate than bagging, but can be prone to overfitting.\\nRileen',\n",

Pickle will reference the class in the global namespace (top-level code): __main__.<custom_class>.\\nWhen using waitress, waitress will load the predict_app module and this will call pickle.load, that will try to find __main__.<custom_class> that does not exist.\\nSolution:\\nPut the class into a separate module and import it in both the script that saves the model (e.g. train.py) and the script that loads the model (e.g. predict.py)\\nNote: If Flask is used (no waitress) in predict.py, and predict.py has the definition of the class, When  it is run: python predict.py, it will work because the class is in the same namespace as the one used when the model was saved (__main__).\\nDetailed info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27732354/unable-to-load-files-using-pickle-and-multiple-modules\\nMarcos MJD\",\n",

A few individually important features might in fact be highly correlated with others, & dropping some might be fine.
